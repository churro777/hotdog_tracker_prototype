- **[Deployment & CI/CD](./technical/deployment.md)**: Build pipeline, hosting, and operational procedures

## 🚀 Quick Start

### For Product Owners

1. Start with [User Flows & Features](./product/user-flows.md) to understand user experience
2. Review [Requirements & Scope](./product/requirements.md) for business context and priorities
3. Reference technical docs when discussing implementation feasibility

### For Engineers

1. Begin with [Architecture Overview](./technical/architecture.md) for system understanding
2. Follow implementation guides for specific features:
   - [Authentication Implementation](./technical/authentication.md)
   - [Leaderboard System](./technical/leaderboard.md)
3. Use [Deployment Guide](./technical/deployment.md) for operational procedures

## 📋 Project Status

### Current State

- ✅ **Infrastructure**: Complete CI/CD pipeline with Firebase hosting

- ✅ **Data Layer**: Firebase Firestore integration with real-time capabilities
- 🔄 **In Progress**: Authentication system and user management

### Next Milestones

1. **Phase 1 (Weeks 1-4)**: User authentication and contest joining
2. **Phase 2 (Weeks 5-8)**: Dynamic leaderboard with real-time updates  
3. **Phase 3 (Weeks 9-12)**: Enhanced social features and optimizations

## 🎯 App Overview

**Hot Dog Tracker** is a real-time competitive eating contest app where users:

- 📝 **Log hot dog consumption** with counts, photos, and descriptions
- 🏆 **Compete on live leaderboards** that update in real-time  
- 👥 **Share progress socially** through activity feeds
- 📊 **Track personal statistics** and achievements over time

### Core Value Proposition

- **Real-time competition**: See rankings update instantly
- **Social engagement**: Community feed and shared experiences
